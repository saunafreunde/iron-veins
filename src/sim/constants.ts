 *  - TICK TIME (real time) drives vehicle physics, loading, signal reservations.
 *    A train at 160 km/h covers 44.4 m per real second, i.e. 2.22 m per tick.
 *  - GAME TIME (calendar) drives dates, vehicle age, industry production, town
 *    growth, financial reports, loan interest and cargo decay.
 *
 * Worked example, kept here because it is the number that makes the whole
 * economy intuitive:
 *   A 60 tile run is 60 * 50 m = 3_000 m.
 *   At 44.4 m/s that is 67.6 s of real time = 1_352 ticks = 6.8 game days.
 * That is why decay grace periods are measured in days rather than hours, and
 * why a 500 tile line is almost always economically worse than an 80 tile one.
 *
 * Moving vehicles on the calendar clock makes a train cross the map in a single
 * frame. Running the calendar on the tick clock makes a game year take eight
 * hours. Both are wrong.
