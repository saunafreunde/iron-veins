# Iron Veins - working rules

A modern successor to Transport Tycoon Deluxe. TypeScript, PixiJS v8, React 18,
simulation in a dedicated web worker, Tauri 2 desktop shell. Fully offline, no
backend, no game engine.

**Read this before touching anything.** The rules below are what keep a project
of this size from collapsing; they are not style preferences.

---

## The ten architecture laws

1. **Sim never sees render.** `src/sim/**` must not import `src/render/**`,
   `src/ui/**`, `src/platform/**`, `pixi.js`, `react` or `zustand`. Enforced by
   `eslint.config.js`, proven by `tests/unit/lint-rules.spec.ts`.
2. **Fixed time step.** The simulation runs at 20 Hz (50 ms). No delta time
   inside the sim - the renderer interpolates between snapshots.
3. **Determinism is mandatory.** Same seed + same command sequence => bit
   identical state. Banned in the sim core: `Math.random`, `Date`,
   `performance`, `window`, `for...in`, `sort()` without a total comparator,
   iteration order as logic.
4. **Only bit-exact float maths in the sim.** `+ - * /` and `Math.sqrt` are
   allowed. Trigonometry goes through the lookup table in `src/sim/math.ts`.
5. **Money is integer cents.** Never floating point euros. Formatting happens in
   the UI only.
6. **All state changes go through commands.** `src/sim/commands/`. The UI never
   mutates sim state. This is what buys replays, undo, save verification and
   later multiplayer.
7. **No allocation in the hot path.** Inside `tick()` and everything below it:
   no object/array literals, no `.map/.filter/.reduce`, no closures, no spread.
   Preallocated buffers and plain `for` loops.
8. **No recursion for network traversal.** Rail graphs reach 100k edges. Always
   iterative with an explicit stack or queue.
9. **IDs, not references.** Entities are addressed by numeric id; object
   references never live in serialisable state.
10. **State changes are atomic per tick.** The renderer always reads a complete
    snapshot through the double-buffered `SharedArrayBuffer`.

## Additional standing rules

- **Every constant lives in `src/sim/constants.ts`**, annotated with unit and
  origin. No magic numbers anywhere else.
- **Every user visible string goes through `t()`** (`src/i18n/`), German and
  English kept in sync.
- **No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, empty function bodies, commented
  out code.** ESLint fails the build on the first three.
- **Every change to the shape of the sim state bumps `SAVE_VERSION` and adds a
  migration** under `src/sim/save/migrations/`.
- **Tests are written with the feature, not after it.**
- Code, comments, identifiers and commit messages in English. Summaries for the
  user in German.

## Time model - the classic trap

Vehicle motion and the calendar run on two different clocks.

| Clock                 | Drives                                            | Unit              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Tick time (real time) | physics, position, loading, signal reservations   | 20 ticks/s        |
| Game time (calendar)  | dates, ageing, production, growth, finance, decay | 200 ticks = 1 day |

1 day = 200 ticks = 10 s at 1x. 1 month = 30 days = 6_000 ticks.
1 year = 360 days = 72_000 ticks = 60 min at 1x. Playable span 1950-2050.

Moving vehicles on the calendar clock makes a train cross the map in one frame.
Running the calendar on the tick clock makes a year take eight hours.

## Layout

```
src/sim/       deterministic simulation (no DOM, no rendering, no host globals)
  SimWorker.ts   worker entry + scheduler - the ONLY file here that may read the
                 wall clock; holds no simulation state
src/render/     PixiJS drawing - reads the sim snapshot, never writes  (from M1)
src/ui/         React panels + zustand store + SimClient
src/shared/     types and buffers both sides need (snapshot, protocol, palette)
src/platform/   the only place that imports @tauri-apps/*
src/i18n/       t() plus de.json / en.json
tools/          build-time generators (icons now, sprite atlases from M1)
tests/unit      unit tests
tests/determinism  the suite that must never be red
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # vite dev server on :5183 (COOP/COEP headers set)
npm run build            # tsc --noEmit && vite build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test                 # everything
npm run test:unit
npm run test:determinism # must never be red
npm run icons            # regenerate src-tauri/icons from tools/make-icons.mjs
npm run tauri dev        # desktop shell - needs the Rust toolchain
```

## Environment note

`npm run tauri dev` / `npm run tauri build` need Rust and the MSVC build tools,
which are **not installed on this machine** as of 2026-07-27:

```bash
winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup -e && winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e
```

Everything else (dev server, build, tests) runs without them.

## Milestone status

M0 done. Next: M1 (map generation, isometric renderer, camera, terraforming).
