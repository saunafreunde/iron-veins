# Iron Veins - working rules

A modern successor to Transport Tycoon Deluxe. TypeScript, PixiJS v8, React 18,
simulation in a dedicated web worker, Tauri 2 desktop shell. Fully offline, no
backend, no game engine.

**Read this before touching anything.** The rules below are what keep a project
of this size from collapsing; they are not style preferences.

---

## The ten architecture laws

1. **Sim never sees render.** `src/sim/**` must not import `src/render/**`,
   `src/ui/**`, `src/platform/**`, `pixi.js`, `react` or `zustand`. Enforced by
   `eslint.config.js`, proven by `tests/unit/lint-rules.spec.ts`.
2. **Fixed time step.** The simulation runs at 20 Hz (50 ms). No delta time
   inside the sim - the renderer interpolates between snapshots.
3. **Determinism is mandatory.** Same seed + same command sequence => bit
   identical state. Banned in the sim core: `Math.random`, `Date`,
   `performance`, `window`, `for...in`, `sort()` without a total comparator,
   iteration order as logic.
4. **Only bit-exact float maths in the sim.** `+ - * /` and `Math.sqrt` are
   allowed. Trigonometry goes through the lookup table in `src/sim/math.ts`.
5. **Money is integer cents.** Never floating point euros. Formatting happens in
   the UI only.
6. **All state changes go through commands.** `src/sim/commands/`. The UI never
   mutates sim state. This is what buys replays, undo, save verification and
   later multiplayer.
7. **No allocation in the hot path.** Inside `tick()` and everything below it:
   no object/array literals, no `.map/.filter/.reduce`, no closures, no spread.
   Preallocated buffers and plain `for` loops.
8. **No recursion for network traversal.** Rail graphs reach 100k edges. Always
   iterative with an explicit stack or queue.
9. **IDs, not references.** Entities are addressed by numeric id; object
   references never live in serialisable state.
10. **State changes are atomic per tick.** The renderer always reads a complete
    snapshot through the double-buffered `SharedArrayBuffer`.

## Additional standing rules

- **Every constant lives in `src/sim/constants.ts`**, annotated with unit and
  origin. No magic numbers anywhere else.
- **Every user visible string goes through `t()`** (`src/i18n/`), German and
  English kept in sync.
- **No `TODO`, `FIXME`, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, empty function bodies, commented
  out code.** ESLint fails the build on the first three.
- **Every change to the shape of the sim state bumps `SAVE_VERSION` and adds a
  migration** under `src/sim/save/migrations/`.
- **Tests are written with the feature, not after it.**
- Code, comments, identifiers and commit messages in English. Summaries for the
  user in German.

## Time model - the classic trap

Vehicle motion and the calendar run on two different clocks.

| Clock                 | Drives                                            | Unit              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Tick time (real time) | physics, position, loading, signal reservations   | 20 ticks/s        |
| Game time (calendar)  | dates, ageing, production, growth, finance, decay | 200 ticks = 1 day |

1 day = 200 ticks = 10 s at 1x. 1 month = 30 days = 6_000 ticks.
1 year = 360 days = 72_000 ticks = 60 min at 1x. Playable span 1950-2050.

Moving vehicles on the calendar clock makes a train cross the map in one frame.
Running the calendar on the tick clock makes a year take eight hours.

## Layout

```
src/sim/       deterministic simulation (no DOM, no rendering, no host globals)
  SimWorker.ts   worker entry + scheduler - the ONLY file here that may read the
                 wall clock; holds no simulation state
src/render/     PixiJS drawing - reads the sim snapshot, never writes  (from M1)
src/ui/         React panels + zustand store + SimClient
src/shared/     types and buffers both sides need (snapshot, protocol, palette)
src/platform/   the only place that imports @tauri-apps/*
src/i18n/       t() plus de.json / en.json
tools/          build-time generators (icons now, sprite atlases from M1)
tests/unit      unit tests
tests/determinism  the suite that must never be red
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # vite dev server on :5183 (COOP/COEP headers set)
npm run build            # tsc --noEmit && vite build
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test                 # everything
npm run test:unit
npm run test:determinism # must never be red
npm run icons            # regenerate src-tauri/icons from tools/make-icons.mjs
npm run tauri dev        # desktop shell - needs the Rust toolchain
```

## Map model

- Heights live on a `(size+1)^2` CORNER grid; a tile owns the four corners
  around it. `+x` runs to the lower right on screen, `+y` to the lower left, so
  the corner called North really is the top one.
- **Invariant:** no two corners of a tile differ by more than one level. That
  gives exactly 16 slopes and no steep-slope special cases. Every routine that
  moves ground has to restore it (`TileMap.enforceSlopeInvariant`, or the
  cascade inside `map/terraform.ts`).
- A tile is water when even its highest corner is at or below `SEA_LEVEL`.
- `landmassId` and `oceanMask` are derived: recomputed on load and after a
  terraform that moved the shoreline, never serialised.

## Environment note

`npm run tauri dev` and `npm run tauri build` need Rust and the MSVC build
tools. Both are installed (Rust 1.97.1, VS 2022 Build Tools, Windows SDK
10.0.26100). If a shell reports `cargo` missing, its environment predates the
install - prepend `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` to PATH.

## Rendering

- The tile layers live in a SharedArrayBuffer the worker owns; `src/render`
  reads them in place through `TileMap.fromBuffer` and never writes.
- Sprites are rebuilt only when the visible tile range, the zoom or the map
  revision changed - never per frame.
- Draw order runs along the diagonals `(x + y)`; a tile's road, building and
  industry sprites follow immediately after its ground.
- The tile artwork is generated at startup by `render/TerrainAtlas.ts`. No
  binary art in the repository.

## Economy

- Every cargo parcel carries a "paid up to" point. A delivery pays for the
  distance from there and moves the marker along, so a journey split across
  several vehicles earns exactly what one direct run would.
- What a town offers a station is its output multiplied by the station rating.
  A badly served stop therefore gets less cargo - the death spiral of section
  10.1 is intended and has to be visible in the UI.
- Loading takes the oldest cargo first. Oversupply therefore shows up as low
  revenue per unit, not as a growing pile: everything carried is stale and pays
  the 10 % floor. If a line earns little, check the queue length first.
- **The balancing tests own the constants.** When `npm run test:balance` leaves
  its band, the tables in `constants.ts` and `vehicles/catalog.ts` change, never
  the test. The bus line scenario prints why it earns what it earns.

## Milestone status

M0, M1 and M2 are done. A bus line can be built, crewed and run entirely from
the interface, and balancing scenario 1 is in band (payback in game year 3).

**Still outstanding, to pick up with M3:**

- The **minimap** (owed since M1).
- Vehicle **hover and selection on the map** - the fleet list is the only way
  to select one at the moment.
- The other **balancing scenarios** of section 19.4. Only scenario 1 exists;
  scenarios 2, 3 and 5 need rail and industry, scenario 4 (bankruptcy from
  doing nothing) could be written now.
- The **lorry, tanker and mail van prices** are first-draft numbers. They move
  cargo that does not exist before M5, so calibrating them now would be tuning
  against a guess (DECISIONS.md D-041).

**M3 is done.** A train can be assembled in an engine shed, given orders and run
over a line the player laid - across rivers and through hills - and it behaves
the way its composition says it should.

Done: eight-direction track, the curve radius table of section 8.1 with its
speed limits, five rail types, the route assistant (A* over tile plus incoming
direction, costs in metre equivalents), manual mode, the build preview, track
rendering, 33 traction units and 23 wagons, train composition, the rail
coefficients in the longitudinal solver, curve-aware braking, train pathfinding
over the track graph, platforms and engine sheds, electrification, track
conversion, bridges and tunnels, and save format v6 with every migration from 2
on.

## Rail - the four things that will bite

1. **Gradients are measured over a window, never tile to tile.** One height
   level is 8 m over a 50 m tile, i.e. 160 per mille, which no rail type can
   accept. See the note in `map/track.ts` and DECISIONS.md D-042. Three places
   use the same measure - the route assistant, `measureRoute` and the
   longitudinal solver - and they have to stay in step.
2. **Track height is `TileMap.railHeight`, never `baseHeight`.** On a bridge the
   two differ by the whole depth of the valley (D-053).
3. **A train is one entity.** Its composition is a list of catalogue ids;
   mass, tractive effort, top speed, length, braking and capacity are cached
   aggregates refreshed by `VehicleStore.refreshAggregate` whenever the train or
   its load changes. Never read a train's properties from its leading spec.
4. **`routeRemainingM` is measured from the start of the current tile**, not
   from the vehicle. The distance left is that minus `progressM`. Two separate
   accumulators drift and strand vehicles one tile short of their platform
   (D-043).

Then M4 (signals) onwards.
